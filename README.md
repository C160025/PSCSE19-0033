# Color Transfer between Images (PSCSE19-0033)
Color Transfer Between Images 

### Way of approach the FYP
- built an open source similar like [VGGface](https://github.com/rcmalli/keras-vggface) 
- explore other [opencv](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html) library for converting between color space with D65 color temperature.
- must install all the necessary library within setup.py
- [color transfer](https://github.com/jrosebr1/color_transfer) github reference
